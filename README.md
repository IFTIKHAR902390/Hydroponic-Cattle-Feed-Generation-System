# Hydroponic-Cattle-Feed-Generation-System
This project is based on microcontrollers and implemented using assembly language. It involves the development of an Automatic Hydroponic Cattle Feed Generation System.

In this system, trays are used to grow cattle feed through the hydroponic method. The entire process is automated:

The trays automatically move to the next stage once they are filled.

Water is automatically supplied to the feed at regular intervals.

The system is designed to reduce manual labor and ensure efficient, timely watering and tray movement using a microcontroller-based control unit programmed in assembly language.
